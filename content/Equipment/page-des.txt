Intel will be providing each team with an Edison board and Grove sensor kit, and your solution
will need to be built on this Intel board. You are also free to bring in other components and
equipment if you feel the need for them. Note that SP Road and other popular shops for
components/equipment will be open as these are weekdays, but it is not advisable to waste
valuable hacking time at the event to purchase components. Please come prepared!
