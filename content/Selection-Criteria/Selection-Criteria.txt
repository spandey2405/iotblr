<h3>1. There must be hardware</h3>
<div class="row des">
This is a connected devices makeathon, so we require you to
build device(s) and connect them to other devices. Software-only ideas will not be
selected, neither will be hardware that is stand-alone and not connected to anything (at
the very least, it should be connected to another device, mobile phone or gateway and
not necessarily to a cloud or other devices via the internet).
</div>


<h3>2. No Work-In-Progress projects allowed</h3>
<div class="row des">
No Work-In-Progress projects allowed - In the spirit of making, we prefer that teams
build their solutions from scratch at this Makeathon rather than coming in with an idea
they have already been working on for some time. Use this as an opportunity to quickly
prototype a new idea that you are excited to explore.
</div>


<h3>3. Build something innovative</h3>
<div class="row des">
We are keen to push the boundaries of what we can
imagine and what we believe to be possible. So we encourage you to apply with out of
the box ideas. If it excites or intrigues us, we’ll invite you to come and build it in 2 days!
</div>



<h3>4. Build something impactful</h3>
<div class="row des">
Build something impactful - Can your solution solve challenges in the real world? Are

you addressing a significant pain point for someone? If so, we’ll support you in

prototyping it.
